<h1>Westminster Black History Cycling Tour</h1>
<br>
<p>I have lived in Westminster all my life and never knew that on my doorstep was this hidden history of peoples past from the African Diaspora.</p>
<p>I set off on bike to discover these former homes, places of work and performance. As this reconnaisance took place during the Covid-19 pandemic, the streets of London were untypically quiet, making it the ideal time to discover London by bike.</p>
<p>The tour starts with the home and workplace of <strong>Dr John Alcindor</strong>.<br><br><img src="https://www.careukgroup.com/sites/group/files/wysiwyg/john%20alcinder%20600%20x%20400.png" width="300" height="250"></p>
<p>Born in Trinidad in 1873, he died in St Marys Hospital, Paddington in 1924. His life's journey took him to Edinburgh University to study medicine, on to various hospitals in London before settling in what was then the borough of Paddington.</p>
<p>He lived in various addresses in the Borough of Paddington, finally setting up surgery and home in 201 Harrow Road which today is still a doctors surgery called the Grand Union Medical Centre.</p><br><img src="https://d2kdkfqxnvpuu9.cloudfront.net/images/big/72388.jpg" height="300" width="300">
<p>Dr Alcindor was a champion for poor people in this area. It was said that he never turned anyone away. From 1917, he was also the Medical Officer of Health for the Paddington Poor Law Guardians.</p>
<p>In July 1900, he was involved in the first Pan-African conference which was held in what was then Westminster Town Hall (today is Caxton Hall).From c.1919-1923, he chaired the African Progress Union.</p>
<p>His obituary in the Bayswater Chronicle of 01st November 1924 states: "Dr Alcindor had a considerable practise among the poor of the Harrow Road neighbourhood, and was very popular among those who used to avail themselves of his medical skill and knowledge. He was both modest and unassuming in his bearing; also of kindly and sympathetic disposition."</p>
<br><hr>
<p>Next stop, 31 Talbot Road, about 5 min ride from the Harrow Road, to a friend of Dr Alcindor, the composer and conductor <strong>Samuel Coleridge - Taylor</strong></p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Samuel_Coleridge-Taylor.jpg" height="300" width="250">
<p>Born in 1875 in Holborn, London. His father was a physician from Sierra Leone and the young Coleridge - Taylor was raised by his mother and step father in Croydon. In 1890, he secured a place at the Royal College of Music, where he initially studied violin and later move onto composition.</p>
<p>He frequently lodged at 31 Talbot Road.</p><br>
<p>He is famous for his works:</p>
<ul><li>Hiawatha's Wedding Feast</li><li>Ballade in A Minor</li><li>Christmas Overture</li><li>Nonet in F Minor</li><li>Deep River</li></ul>
<br>
<p>He died of pneumonia at the young age of 37 leaving a wife and two children. Interestingly, the circumstances of his death led to the system of royalties for composers in the UK.</p><br>

<hr>
<p>On to a home once lived in by the late, great <strong>Bob Marley</strong>.12a Queensborough Terrace.</p>
<br>
<img src="https://media.timeout.com/images/103314930/image.jpg" height="300" width="300"><br>
<p>In the early 70s, The Wailers came to London where they were signed up by Island Records.</p>
<p>In London, Bob lived in various addresses including 12a Queensborough Terrace in Bayswater, Westminster. This was (possibly still is) a B&B style hostel. Bob and his band were resident here for about three months. It may not have been a good time for them, as they shared one room with no kitchen facility. Music historian, Russell Clarke, says "They existed on fish and chips and Indian vegetarian food inbetween rehearsing and writing songs". They complained so much about their accommodation, their management moved them onto better lodgings.</p>

<br>
<p>I have known about <strong> Mary Seacole</strong> for a while and it is shameful that such a profilic contributor and healthcare provider to the British people during time of war should have been white washed from history.</p>
<p>A medical centre in Surrey has recently been named <a href="https://www.surreyheartlands.uk/nhs-seacole-centre-headley-court-surrey-ready-for-covid-19-rehabilitation/">the NHS Seacole</a> specifically in response to the Covid 19.</p>
<p>Mary Jane Seacole was born in Kingston, Jamaica in 1805. Learning the healing arts from her mother, she went onto become a "skilful nurse and doctress". She travelled widely and on a second visit to the UK in 1854, she heard about the nursing crisis in the Crimean War. She offered her services as a nurse to the War Office but was rejected due to her ethnicity. 
<p>Did she give up? <div class="No"><span>No! (Hover here)</span></div>
</p>

<p>She funded her own trip to the Crimea, where she tended the wounded on the battlefield and established the "British Hotel" for sick and convalescing soldiers.</p>
<p>By the time she came back to England, she was bankrupt. After the media highlighted her case, a benefit festival was held in her honour and was supported by many performers and the Crimean commanders. It was held in the Royal Surrey Garens.</p>
<p>She was awarded the Crimean Medal and the French Legion of Honour amongst other honours.</p>
<p>She died on the 14th May 1881 at her home in 3 Cambridge Square in Paddington. Today, her home no longer exists in its original state. I looked at the gardens in the middle of the square and wondered if she would spend time in this small garden during the winter years of her life.</p>

<hr>
<p>My final stop is <strong> Caxton Hall.</strong></p>
<p>A lovely scenic ride from the former home of Mary Seacole through Hyde Park and past Buckingham Palace to Caxton Hall in Victoria</p>
<p>The former home of Westminster Town Hall has a rich history including:
	<ol>
		<li>The first large meeting for The Womenâ€™s Social and Political Union (WSPU)</li>
		<li>The press briefing area during World War II by the Ministry of Information and Winston Churchill</li>
		<li>A registry office from 1933 to 1978 hosting the weddings of many famous people including:</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Elizabeth Taylor</li>
		<li>Peter Sellers</li>
		<li>Barry Gibb</li>
		<li>Orson Welles</li></ul>
	<li>But purpose of visiting is to see the location of the first Pan African conference in July 1900.</li>
</ol>
